## Introduction
[Emily Black](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~emilybla/) is a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. She is advised by [Matt Fredrikson](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfredrik/) in the Accountable Systems Lab. Her research is focused on make machine learning and deep learning systems more fair and transparent. She is interested in understanding the different ways in which models can exhibit unfair behavior, and finding reliable ways to audit models for these behaviors. This presentation focuses on ethics and its relation to AI and robot learning. 

## Engineering Ethics

### What is Engineering Ethics?
We may think that ethics is an odd topic to think about in the context of engineering as we often think of ethics in relation to philosophy and other seemingly unrelated topics. Engineer ethics is a very **applied area of ethics** where we see how the decision and designs carried out by engineers imply values to other humans and our society. It affects how we design regulation, create technical standards, make design choices, and engage the public around engineering projects. 

This may sometimes feel strange that the tools and algorithms that we create can have ethical consequences. A great detailed overview and exposition of how technologies can have ethical and political consequences is "Do Artifacts Have Politics?" by Langdon Winner <d-cite key="winner"></d-cite>. It goes through specific examples of technological advances and their consequences<d-footnote>For example, he writes about how a pneumatic molding machine was created for manufacturing that was actually less effective and costlier than skilled human workers. At first glance it may seem like the natural progression of technology, but, within broader historical context, it can be seen that it was used to get rid of the higher-skilled unionized workers.</d-footnote>. 

### Ethical Thinking for Responsible Engineering 
The ultimate goal is for each of us to think of our individaul responsiblitiy as people who make complicated systems that will be interacting with others and affecting others lives. Most people won't understand how our systems work and are putting their trust in us. This is a large responsibilty. This doesn't mean we shouldn't release any of our work for fear there might be an unforseen consequences, but rather we should do the best we can to look for these effects or reach out to others who may be able to give us the insights we need. 

## Quick Spectagram Exercise

Think about the following question and how you would respond:

<div align="center"><font size="+2"><strong><i><B>It's the engineer's responsibility to make sure the projects they work on don't hurt people.</B></i></strong></font></div>
